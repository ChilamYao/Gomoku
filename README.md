## - 1. Five pieces with the same color are connected in a row, can be in any direction. (Including Vertical, Horizontal and Diagonal) 
### tips: while the opponet has 3 piece in a row without any other player's piece that was set beside, if you don't have the '3' or 4 piece in a row which doesn't have been block by both side before opponet has it, you have to block it by either side, other wise you are gonna lose.
